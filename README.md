GitHub MCP + CrewAI + Django Integration

This project demonstrates how to:

🚀 Run and validate GitHub MCP Server commands locally to fetch repository data.

🛠️ Use LangChain to convert MCP commands into reusable tools.

🤝 Build and manage a multi-agent Crew workflow.

⚡ Integrate CrewAI seamlessly with a Django application.


🔎 Overview

This repository brings together GitHub MCP, LangChain, CrewAI, and Django to create a powerful framework for managing multi-agent workflows that interact with GitHub data.

By turning MCP commands into reusable tools and connecting them to a CrewAI orchestration layer, you can automate workflows and integrate them directly into your Django applications.

✨ Features

Local Validation: Run and test GitHub MCP Server commands on your machine.

LangChain Integration: Transform MCP commands into modular, reusable tools.

Multi-Agent Workflow: Build CrewAI-powered crews for automation and collaboration.

Django Compatibility: Integrate directly with Django for web applications.
